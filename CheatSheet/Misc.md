Evil-WinRM uses the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to give you an interactive shell on the Windows host. Winrm Supports PKINIT, meaning if you have a computers PFX file, you can authenticate and get a shell. Note that the command requires a public and a private key in PEM format, that can be extracted by converting the PFX to PEM format. Take a look at the references for more info on that. Password protected PFX files can be cracked with JohnTheRipper.
