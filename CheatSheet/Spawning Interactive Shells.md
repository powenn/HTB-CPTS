# AWK
AWK is a C-like pattern scanning and processing language present on most UNIX/Linux-based systems, widely used by developers and sysadmins to generate reports. It can also be used to spawn an interactive shell. This is shown in the short awk script below:
```
awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}'
```

# Find
```
find / -name nameoffile -exec /bin/awk 'BEGIN {system("/bin/sh")}' \;
```
This use of the find command is searching for any file listed after the -name option, then it executes awk (/bin/awk) and runs the same script we discussed in the awk section to execute a shell interpreter.

# Using Exec To Launch A Shell
```
find . -exec /bin/sh \; -quit
```

# VIM

```

```
